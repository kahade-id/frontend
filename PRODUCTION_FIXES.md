- Applied production fixes: env var standardization to VITE_API_BASE_URL across README and GitHub workflows.
- Removed stray *.bak files and added *.bak to .gitignore.
- Added root ESLint v9 flat config + required devDependencies.
- Made all packages buildable with tsup to dist/ and updated package exports to dist outputs.
- Updated turbo.json: lint/type-check no longer depend on build for faster CI.
- Refactored api-config.ts to remove hardcoded production domains and rely on VITE_API_BASE_URL.
